# Data Visualisation final project

This repository contains the visualisations for the Data Visualisation exam at UniTs.


## Project organisation

The project is organised as follows:
* The `couples/`, `gap/` and `gender/` folders contain the code and the resulting visualisations;
* `beamer_presentation/` contains a beamer presentation for the visualisations;
* `imbd_dataset_parsed.json` is a parsed version of the dataset used to produce the visualisations. Please refer to the beamer presentation for the data source.
